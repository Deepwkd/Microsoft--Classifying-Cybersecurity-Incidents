Repository Overview
This repository contains three primary Jupyter notebooks that contribute to a machine learning pipeline focused on feature engineering, data preparation, and model training. Each notebook covers distinct phases of the workflow, allowing a modular approach to the data science process.

1. Notebook: data_features.ipynb
   
Key Components:

Data Cleaning: Handles missing values in features and removes rows or columns with substantial missing data.

Encoding: Categorical variables are encoded, possibly using OneHotEncoder or other methods to create numerical representations.

Feature Transformation: Numerical features undergo scaling or normalization to prepare for model training.

Code Insights: The notebook uses robust methods to identify and handle missing values, ensuring the dataset is complete and standardized. This step is critical in ensuring the model receives high-quality data.

3. Notebook: Data_prep.ipynb

Key Components:
Train-Test Split: The dataset is split into training and testing subsets to validate the model’s performance.

Preprocessing Pipelines: Implements preprocessing pipelines to consistently handle transformations, such as scaling and encoding, on both training and test data.

Code Insights: The focus on a pipeline approach adds flexibility to the project, allowing for seamless adjustments to data preparation steps without disrupting the overall workflow. This structured approach helps maintain reproducibility across different data subsets or future datasets.

4. Notebook: Microsoft_final_Model.ipynb

Key Components:
Model Training: The notebook trains the Gradient Boosting model on the preprocessed data.

Evaluation: Evaluates the model’s accuracy and provides performance metrics, focusing on optimizing and validating prediction accuracy.

Model Export: The trained model pipeline is saved as car_price_model_pipeline.pkl, making it accessible for deployment or further evaluation.

Code Insights: The notebook demonstrates a clear focus on reproducible model training. By saving the model pipeline, future users or applications can seamlessly load and use the model for predictions without retraining, saving computational resources.

Summary and Insights

This repository is well-organized into distinct notebooks, each targeting a specific phase of the machine learning workflow. The approach ensures that each task—feature engineering, data preparation, and model training—can be managed, updated, and debugged independently. The pipeline design, particularly in data preparation and model training, improves the flexibility and scalability of the project. ​
